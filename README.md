Senior Project:
PRIVATE SEARCH ENGINE

ABSTRACT:
The goal of this project was to build a private search engine and provide proof that its funcational and how it protects the users personal information. The private search engine called "SEARX" was used during the completion of this project. Presentation slides are provided with information on the configuration process of the project. Python code and examples were given in providing accurate proof that the users information in secure. (e.g Ultra Secret Key configuration & Disabled logging)

CHALLENGES:
* Configuration and building Searx can be tricky. However, its bit easier using VirtualBox if not to familiar with VMWare. 
** Note.....Make sure to take a 'Snapshot' of your virtual machine. Just in case something goes wrong you can go back to when it worked.

* Finding and understanding the communication or how the user knows if Searx is communicating with e.g. Google.
** Note.....Learn to read and understand Python language.
